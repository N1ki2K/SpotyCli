# SpotyCli Development Session Summary

## Project Overview
- Built a terminal-based Spotify client in Rust using Spotify Web API
- Uses Ratatui for TUI, Tokio for async, and implements real playback controls
- Three-panel layout: sidebar (library/playlists), main content (search/tracks), bottom player

## Key Features Implemented
✅ **Authentication & API Integration**
- OAuth 2.0 PKCE flow for user authentication
- Separate binary for authentication: `cargo run --bin authenticate`
- Token persistence in `.spotify_tokens` file
- Client Credentials flow for basic API access

✅ **Real Music Playback**
- Play tracks with Enter key (uses real Spotify API)
- Space bar: play/pause toggle
- n/p: next/previous track
- +/-: volume control
- All controls work with actual Spotify playback

✅ **Search & Navigation**
- Press `/` to search, type query, Enter to search
- Real Spotify API search results (not mock data)
- Arrow keys (↑/↓) for navigation
- Shows "Recently Played" by default, switches to search results when searching

✅ **Device Detection & Troubleshooting**
- 5-second startup delay with option to press 'u' for device check
- Shows available Spotify devices and which are active
- Clear error messages for common issues (no devices, premium required, etc.)

└── authenticate.rs   # Separate authentication binary
```

## Usage Instructions

### First Time Setup
1. Get Spotify API credentials from https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/
2. Set environment variables or create `.env` file:
   ```
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id_here
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret_here
   ```

### Authentication for Playback
1. Run: `cargo run --bin authenticate`
2. Follow browser authentication flow
3. Tokens saved to `.spotify_tokens`

### Running the App
1. `cargo run`
2. **NEW**: 5-second startup - press 'u' to check Spotify devices
3. Use the app:
   - `/` - search for music
   - ↑/↓ - navigate tracks
   - Enter - play selected track
   - Space - play/pause
   - n/p - next/previous
   - +/- - volume
   - u - check device status
   - q - quit

## Issues Fixed in This Session

### 1. Navigation Not Working
**Problem**: Arrow keys didn't work for track selection
**Solution**: Fixed `move_selection()` function and proper `ListState` handling

### 2. Search Results Format Issues
**Problem**: Search showed "test - Nothing Else Matters - Metallica" format
**Solution**: Updated to use real Spotify API search, proper track formatting

### 3. Playback Not Working
**Problem**: No actual music playback - just UI placeholders
**Solution**:
- Connected all UI controls to real Spotify API calls
- Made functions async to handle API calls
- Added proper error handling with specific messages

### 4. Audio Troubleshooting
**Problem**: User couldn't hear music
**Solution**:
- Added device detection functionality
- 5-second startup delay with 'u' option to check devices
- Clear error messages for common issues:
  - No active devices
  - Spotify Premium required
  - No devices found

## Current Status
✅ **Fully Functional Spotify Terminal Client**
- Real authentication with Spotify
- Real music playback and controls
- Device detection and troubleshooting
- Search with real Spotify API
- Proper navigation and UI

## Requirements for Playback
1. **Spotify Premium account** (required for playback API)
2. **Active Spotify device** (desktop app, mobile, or web player)
3. **Authentication tokens** (run authenticate binary first)
4. **Device must be "active"** (start playing something in Spotify first)

## Common Troubleshooting
- Press 'u' at startup or in-app to check device status
- If "No active device": Open Spotify app and start playing something
- If "Premium required": Need Spotify Premium for playback control
- If "No devices found": Make sure Spotify app is running

## Next Steps (if needed)
- Could add playlist creation/management
- Could add current playback status display
- Could add more advanced search filters
- Could add queue management
